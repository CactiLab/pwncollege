# Getting Started

At the core of pwn.college is flags. How do you get those flags? Solve challenges. You can start a challenge by clicking on the `Challenges` tab at the top, selecting a module, clicking on a particular level, and hitting `Start`. In order to access that challenge, you have two options.

The first option is using the `Workspace` tab. This will present you with a fully functional development environment in your browser via Visual Studio Code. You can, for instance, quickly open a new terminal by pressing `F1`, searching for `New Terminal`, and pressing enter.

The second option is using `ssh`. In order to ssh into your challenge instances, you must add a public ssh key to `Settings` > `SSH Key`. You can quickly generate an ssh key by running `ssh-keygen -f key -N ''` in a terminal on your (unix-friendly) host machine. This will generate files `key` and `key.pub`, which are your private and public keys respectively. Once you have linked your ssh key to your account, you can run `ssh -i key hacker@dojo.pwn.college` to connect into your challenge instance.

Once you are in a challenge instance, your goal is to get the contents of the `/flag` file. Unfortunately for you, you are executing as the `hacker` user, but `/flag` is only readable by the `root` user. Fortunately, however, there are challenge programs located inside of the `/challenge` directory, which when run, will run with the privileges of the `root` user. Solve the challenge to get the `/flag`, and then submit it in order to complete the challenge!

A few things to note. Your home directory `/home/hacker` is persistent. This means that when you start a new challenge, all of the files you have saved in there will still be there. The `Practice` button can be incredibly useful for debugging your solution. When you start a challenge in this way, you will have the ability to run programs as the `root` user with the `sudo` command; however, the instance will only have a practice flag. For some of the later (kernel-focused) challenges, you will need to solve the challenge in a virtual machine. You can interact with the virtual machine using the `vm` command.


# About

PwnIoT Academy is an Internet-of-Things (IoT) capture-the-flag (CTF) platform developed and maintained by [Ziming Zhao](https://zzm7000.github.io/) and the members of [CactiLab](https://cactilab.github.io/). It provides CTF challenges for a wide range of hardware architectures, including x86/64, ARM Cortex-A, Cortex-M, and RISC-V. It powers University at Buffalo's CSE 418/518 Software Security course and will be publicly accessible, open, and free for anyone interested.

Members of CactiLab who have contributed to PwnIoT Academy include [Md Armanuzzaman](https://tomal-kuet.github.io/armanuzzaman/), [Dikshit Khandelwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dikshitkhandelwal/), and [Elijah Sippel](https://elijah.fyi/).

PwnIoT is a fork from [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/), which is based on [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd). Kudos to pwn.college and CTFd!!
